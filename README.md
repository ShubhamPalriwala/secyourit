- [Max/Secret-Scan](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/secret-scan) to scan for tokens and sensitive date
- [VChain-US/Verify-Action](https://github.com/vchain-us/verify-action) to verify the authenticity of the commits
- [AquaSecurity/Trivy-Action](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action) to scan the file system and the dependencies for vulnerabilities
- [Snyk/Actions](https://github.com/snyk/actions) to perform Software Composition Analysis
